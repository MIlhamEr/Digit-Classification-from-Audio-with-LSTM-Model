# Digit Classification from Audio with LSTM-Model ðŸ”¢

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust model capable of accurately identifying numerical sounds uttered by diverse speakers. The project encompasses the training and evaluation of machine learning models, including RNN-LSTM, within the domain of speech recognition. The core task involves audio processing such as MFCC audio feature extraction designed for precise numerical voice identification of diverse speakers for comprehensive model training and testing.
