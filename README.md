# Digit-Classification-from-Audio-with-LSTM-Model

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust model capable of accurately identifying numerical sounds uttered by diverse speakers. The project encompasses the training and evaluation of machine learning models, including RNN-LSTM, within the domain of speech recognition. Core tasks involve intricate audio processing and the extraction of audio features such as spectrogram, mel-spectrogram, and MFCC for comprehensive model training and testing.
